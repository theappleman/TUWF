=head1 NAME

TUWF::XML - Easy XML and HTML generation with Perl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides an easy and simple method for generating XML (and with
that, HTML) documents in Perl. Unlike most other TUWF modules, this one can be
used separately, outside of the TUWF framework.

The goal of this module is to make HTML generation B<easier>, it is certainly
not a goal to abstract HTML generation behind generalized functions and
objects. Nor is it a goal to ensure the correctness of the generated HTML, that
remains the responsibility of the programmer (although this module can
certainly help). You will still be writing HTML yourself, the only difference
is that you use a more convenient syntax and you won't have to manually escape
everything you output.

The primary aim of this module was to generate XHTML, and since XHTML is a
subset of XML, extending it to write XML was a small step. In fact, this module
is basically an XML generator with convenience functions for XHTML.

This module provides two interfaces: a functional interface and an object
interface. Both can be used, even at the same time. The object interface is
required in threaded environments or when you want to generate multiple
documents simultaneously, while the functional interface is far more
convenient, but has some limitations and contributes to namespace pollution.

The functional interface looks like this:

  use TUWF::XML ':html';
  # -- or, from within a TUWF website:
  use TUWF ':html';
  
  TUWF::XML->new(default => 1);
  html;
   head;
    title 'Document title!';
   end;
  end 'html';

And the equivalent, using the object interface:

  # not required when used within a TUWF website
  use TUWF::XML;
  
  my $xml = TUWF::XML->new();
  $xml->html;
   $xml->head;
    $xml->title('Document title!');
   $xml->end;
  $xml->end('html');

You may also combine the two interfaces by setting the I<default> option in
C<new()> and mixing method calls and function calls, but that is rather
inconsistent and messy.

TUWF automatically calls C<TUWF::XML-E<gt>new(default =E<gt> 1, ..)> at the start of
each request, so you can start generating XML or HTML using the functional
interface without having to initialize this module. Of course, if you wish to
generate an other XML document while processing a request, you should use the
object interface for that, otherwise this may cause problems with other
functions within the TUWF framework that assume that the default C<TUWF::XML>
object has been set to output to TUWF.

=head1 FUNCTION-ONLY FUNCTIONS

=head2 new(options)

Creates a new XML generator object, accepts the following options:

=over

=item default

0/1. When set to a true value, the newly created object will be used as the
default object: Any regular function call (that is, without an object) to any
of the functions listed in L<METHODS & FUNCTIONS|/"METHODS & FUNCTIONS"> will
act as if they were called on this object. Until a new object is created with
the I<default> option set, in which case the default object will be overwritten
again. Default: 0.

=item write

Should contain a subroutine reference that accepts a string as argument. This
subroutine will be called whenever there is data to output. If this option is
not specified, a default function that writes to C<stdout> is used.

=item pretty

Set to a positive integer to pretty-print the generated XML, set to 0 to
disable pretty-printing. The integer indicates the number of spaces to use for
each new level of indentation. It is recommended to have pretty-printing
disabled when generating HTML, since white-space around HTML elements tends to
have significance when being rendered, and with pretty-printing you will lose
the control on where to (not) insert whitespace. Default: 0 (disabled).

=back

=head2 xml_escape(string)

Returns the XML-escaped string. The characters C<&>, C<E<lt>>, C<E<gt>> and
C<"> will be replaced with their XML entity.

=head2 html_escape(string)

Does the same as C<xml_escape()>, but also replaced newlines with
C<E<lt>br /E<gt>> tags.

=head1 METHODS & FUNCTIONS

=head2 lit(string)

Output the given string B<lit>erally, without modification or escaping. This is
equivalent to just calling the I<write> subroutine passed to C<new()>.

=head2 txt(string)

XML-escape the string and then output it, equivalent to
C<lit(xml_escape $string)>.

=head2 xml()

Writes the following XML header:

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

Since this function does not open a tag, it does not have to be C<end()>'ed.

=head2 html(options)

Writes an XHTML doctype and opens an C<E<lt>htmlE<gt>> tag. Accepts the
following options:

=over

=item doctype

Specify the doctype to use. Can be one of the following:

  html5 xhtml1-strict xhtml1-transitional xhtml1-frameset
  xhtml11 xhtml-basic11 xhtml-math-svg

Apart from I<html5>, these refer to the doctypes found at
L<http://www.w3.org/QA/2002/04/valid-dtd-list.html>. Default: xhtml1-strict.

=item lang

Specifies the (human) language of the generated content. This will generate a
C<lang> and C<xml:lang> attribute for the html open tag.

=item I<anything else>

Any option besides I<doctype> and I<lang> is added as attribute to html open
tag.

=back

Since this opens an C<E<lt>htmlE<gt>> tag, it should be closed with an
C<end()>.

=head2 tag(name, attribute => value, .., contents)

Generates an XML tag or element. The first argument is the name of the tag,
attributes can be specified after that with key/value pairs and finally the
contents can be specified. If the I<contents> argument is not present, an open
tag will be generated, which should be closed later on using C<end()>. If
I<contents> is present but undef, the generated tag will be self-closing, i.e.
it will end with a C</E<gt>> instead of a regular C<E<gt>>. If I<contents> is
present and not undef, it will be used as the contents of the tag, after which
the tag will be closed with a closing tag (C<E<lt>/tagnameE<gt>>).

The tag name and attribute names are outputted as-is, after some very basic
validation. The attribute values and contents are passed through
C<xml_escape()>.

Some example function calls and their output:

  tag('items');
  # <items>
  end();
  # </items>
  
  tag('link', href => '/', undef);
  # <link href="/" />
  
  tag('a', href => '/?f&c', title => 'Homepage', 'link');
  # <a href="/f&amp;c" title="Homepage">link</a>
  
  tag('summary', type => 'html', 'I can write in <b>bold</b>');
  # <summary type="html">I can write in &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;</summary>
  
  tag qw{content type xhtml xml:base http://example.com/ xml:lang en}, $content;
  # is equivalent to:
  lit '<content type="xhtml" xml:base="http://example.com/" xml:lang="en">';
  txt $content;
  lit '</content>';
  # except tag() can do pretty-printing when requested

=head2 end(name)

Closes the last tag opened by C<tag()> or C<html()>. The I<name> argument is
optional, when given, it will be used as validation. If the given I<name> does
not equal the last opened tag, an error is thrown.

=head2 <xhtml-tag>(attribute => value, .., contents)

For convenience, all XHTML 1.0 tags have their own function that acts as a
shorthand for calling C<tag()>. The following functions are defined:

  a abbr acronym address area b base bdo big blockquote body br button caption
  cite code col colgroup dd del dfn div dl dt em fieldset form h1 h2 h3 h4 h5
  h6 head i img input ins kbd label legend li Link Map meta noscript object ol
  optgroup option p param pre q samp script Select small span strong style Sub
  sup table tbody td textarea tfoot th thead title Tr tt ul var

Note that some functions start with an upper-case character. This is to avoid
problems with reserved words or overriding Perl core functions with the same
name.

Some tags are I<boolean>, meaning that they should always be self-closing and
not have any contents. To generate these tags with C<tag()>, you have to
specify undef as the I<contents> argument. This is not required when using
these convenience functions, the undef argument is automatically added for the
following tags:

  area base br img input Link param

Again, some examples:
  
  br;  # tag 'br', undef;
  div; # tag 'div';

  title 'Page title';
  # tag 'title', 'Page title';

  Link rel => 'shortcut icon', href => '/favicon.ico';
  # tag 'link', rel => 'shortcut icon', href => '/favicon.ico', undef;

  textarea rows => 10, cols => 50, $content;
  # tag 'textarea', rows => 10, cols => 50, $content;


=head1 IMPORT OPTIONS

By default, TUWF::XML does not export anything. You can import any specific
function (except C<new()>) by specifying it on the C<use> line:

  use TUWF::XML 'lit', 'html_escape', 'br';

  # after which you can call those functions as follows:
  lit html_escape $content;
  br;

Or you can import an entire group of functions by adding C<:xml> or C<:html> to
the list. The C<:xml> group consists of the functions C<xml()>, C<lit()>,
C<txt()>, C<tag()>, and C<end()>. The C<:html> group consists of all xhtml-tag
functions in addition to the following: C<html()>, C<lit()>, C<txt()>,
C<tag()> and C<end()>.

When using this module in a TUWF website, you can substitute C<TUWF::XML> with
C<TUWF>. The main TUWF module will then redirect its import argments to this
module. This saves some typing, and allows you to import functions from other
TUWF modules on the same C<use> line.
