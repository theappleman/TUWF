TUWF - The Ultimate Website Framework


  This package provides the following set of modules:

    TUWF
    TUWF::DB
    TUWF::XML
    TUWF::Misc
    TUWF::Request
    TUWF::Response


  Dependencies:

    Required
      CGI::Minimal

    Optional
      DBI              for SQL functionality (TUWF::DB)
      FCGI             to run in a FastCGI environment
      Time::HiRes      with debugging enabled
      PerlIO::gzip     output compression
      CGI::Cookie::XS  to parse HTTP cookies


  Notes on usage

    The documentation is still quite lacking, see README.concept for a general
    overview, check examples/ for some examples, and read the source code for
    more information.

    The API of this module is in flux, and I am not one to care much about
    backwards compatibility. If you decide to use TUWF, either get one version
    and stick to that, or be sure to read all commit messages if you want to
    stay up-to-date.


  TODO

    * Implement own CGI and cookie handling functions
    * More liberal/better configurable code layouting
      (not limited to the [sitename]/(Handler|Util|DB)/*.pm layout)
    * Documentation!
    * Improve SQL abstraction
    * Improve data validation
    * Ports and testing for more enviroments
    * Better examples
    * Test suite
    * Proper perl module packaging (Module::Build)
